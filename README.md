# PowerMate Linux Driver

This is a small Linux userspace driver for the [Griffin PowerMate](https://store.griffintechnology.com/desktop/powermate). Tested on Archlinux by me August 6th 2016. Previously tested only on Ubuntu 14.10, 15.04, and 15.10. I am forking this just to add this comment that after adding the udev rules and running powermate this works flawless in Archlinux/Antergos.

For an easy to use PPA, use: https://launchpad.net/~stefansundin/+archive/ubuntu/powermate

# Installation

Create a udev rule by creating the file `/etc/udev/rules.d/60-powermate.rules`

```
ACTION=="add", ENV{ID_USB_DRIVER}=="powermate", SYMLINK+="input/powermate", MODE="0666"
```

After creating the file, unplug and plug the device back in.

Download the binary [here](https://github.com/stefansundin/powermate-linux/releases/latest).


# Run

Simply run the executable with `./powermate`.

Make it run automatically on login somehow. The program can handle the device being disconnected and connected without problems.


# Compile

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev libnotify-dev
make
```
